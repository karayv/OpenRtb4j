 * A {@link BidResponse} can contain multiple “seatbid” objects, each on behalf
 * of a different bidder seat. Since a bid request can include multiple
 * impressions, each “seatbid” object can contain multiple bids each pertaining
 * to a different impression on behalf of a seat. Thus, each “bid” object must
 * include the impression ID to which it pertains as well as the bid price. The
 * “group” attribute can be used to specify if a seat is willing to accept any
 * impressions that it can win (default) or if it is only interested in winning
 * any if it can win them all (i.e., all or nothing).
